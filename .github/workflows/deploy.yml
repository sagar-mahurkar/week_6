        run: docker build -t $IMAGE:$GITHUB_SHA .
        # Builds the Docker image from the Dockerfile in the repo

      # 6️⃣ Push Docker image to Artifact Registry
      - name: Push Docker image
        run: docker push $IMAGE:$GITHUB_SHA
        # Uploads the image to Artifact Registry for GKE to pull

      # 7️⃣ Fetch GKE credentials (handles auth plugin automatically)
